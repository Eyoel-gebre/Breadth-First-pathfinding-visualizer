# Breadth-First-pathfinding-visualizer
A simple visualizer that shows how the breadth first path-finding algorithim works using a 10 X 10 grid.

How to use:
1. You can place start/end nodes by pressing the scroll wheel on your mouse. (you must have a mouse to be able to use the app)
2. You can place walls/obstacles by holding down the left button on the mouse and dragging.
3. You can delete walls/obstacles by holding down the right button on the mouse and dragging.

The app isn't anywhere near perfect, and still has some issues.
(Make sure you install pygame beforehand)
